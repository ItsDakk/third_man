        <p>Indomitable, strenuous, virtuous, ambitious, brilliant. His name could be a synonym for any of these adjectives and many more that have been used to describe his character. Theodore Roosevelt's death was over 100 years ago, but the story of him battling against his frailty as a child and embracing the mantle of greatness to become one of America's most prolific politicians is the very meaning of the phrase “indomitable human spirit”.</p>

        <p class="wiki-info">Beyond his accomplishments though, I think many are drawn to Theodore Roosevelt’s life story because they can see themselves in them. It is not just his accomplishments that draw us to marvel at Theodore Roosevelt's legacy, but the sheer grit of not accepting mediocrity motivates us.
